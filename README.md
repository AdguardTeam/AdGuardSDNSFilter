# AdGuard DNS filter

Formerly *AdGuard Simplified Domain names filter*.

A filter composed of several other filters (AdGuard Base filter, Social media filter, Tracking Protection filter, Mobile Ads filter, EasyList and EasyPrivacy) and simplified specifically to be better compatible with DNS-level ad blocking.

The direct link to the filter: https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt.

Please note, that to use this filter it is necessary to support [basic ad blocking rules syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters). It does not make much sense to extract just the hosts file.

This is a default filter for [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) and for the public [AdGuard DNS](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html) servers.

### How to build AdGuard DNS filter manually

```
yarn install
yarn run build
```

The output is written to `Filters/filter.txt`.

## AdGuard DNS Popup Hosts filter

DNS-level blocking is a crude method that makes a blocked website appear as if it were malfunctioning from the user's perspective. While this approach may suffice for blocking sub-requests to trackers, it is less effective when a user attempts to access a blocked domain directly.

This filter blocks domains that the users tend to open (more precisely, they are opened against the users' will) and it redirects them to a designated "blocked page", which provides explanations regarding the reasons for blocking.

Although redirecting to a different IP address is not the ideal solution, we are hopeful that the [Structured Errors proposal](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-structured-dns-error/) will gain momentum. This would allow us to implement a better solution.

## AdGuard DNS Popup Hosts filter structure

The AdGuard DNS Popup Hosts filter includes only rules that contain the modifiers `popup`, `all`, and `document` from the lists provided. This selection effectively means that these rules are directed at sites that open in the main frame.
